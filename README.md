# Sketch Accuracy Checker
Generate regular polygons from n=3 to n=10\
Generate ellipse with additional focal length parameter (distance between the two foci), length of 0 produces a circle\
Allow user to draw their own shape (ensure shape is simple closed curve, can be done by terminating line at first intersect)\
Use this sucker to find approximate center: https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel\
Two modes: one with outline of shape availabe, one where only center point is given\
