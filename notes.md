# **Notes from Github startup assignment**

Commit changes early and often\
VSCode is a blessing in that it does most of Git for you\
Use the source control tab on the left hand side of VSCode to access commit, pull, push, etc.\
Write commit messages that are concise but also explain what on earth happened
